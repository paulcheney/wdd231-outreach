    <p>Student outreach includes any work you do to build relationships with students, help clarify course content and
      assignment expectations, and encourage students to persist and do their best in the class. Though some additional
      instruction may be given by week or course, student outreach assignments generally fall into the following
      categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-participating and Failing Students</strong> - In the initial weeks of a course, and at key times
        surrounding academic deadlines, you should reach out to students who are in danger of failing the course due to
        either low participation or failing grades. Message templates are provided in relevant weeks to assist you in
        reaching out to this student group.</li>
      <li><strong>Missing Assignments</strong> - Starting in Week 02, you should reach out to any students in your class
        who are missing high-stakes assessments. Specific assessments will be identified in your course-specific
        outreach tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>At-Risk Students</strong> - Some students may not be missing a high-stakes assessment, but they could
        use additional instructor help because they have received a lower grade on the assessment. Starting in Week 02,
        you will be asked to reach out to students who have scored low on a high-stakes assessment with an eye toward
        tutoring the student on specific concepts that could help them succeed. You may also allow students in this
        group to resubmit their assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Positive Outreach</strong> - Part of good student outreach is not just focusing on students who may
        need additional help, but building relationships and presence with those who are already succeeding. Besides
        reaching out to students who are missing or scoring low on key assessments, you will also be prompted to reach
        out to students who have scored highly, recognizing their good work.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Feedback on Course Content</strong> - Depending on the course, you may be asked to review
        certain assignments in order to give individual students or student groups additional feedback on key concepts
        so they can succeed in future assignments.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspired Outreach</strong> - As an instructor in your course, pray for your students. You may receive
        additional inspiration and guidance on other ways you can positively influence and encourage the students in
        your class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="pop"><strong>Communication Channels:</strong> When communicating with students one-on-one, use <strong>MS Teams</strong>. <br>When sending group outreach messages for assignment progress, use <strong>Canvas Gradebook</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Before Class Begins - <span id="sendWelcomeEmail"></span></h2>
    <h3>Send an Email</h3>
    
    <div class="good">
      <p>Modify the following message and then email it to all students using Canvas Inbox.</p>
      <section>
      <p>SUBJECT: Welcome to WDD231, the best class ever!</p>

      <p>What a fantastic opportunity to work with students from around the world who share a common faith.</p>
      <p>Class begins on <span id="classStart2"></span>, and we must hit the ground running.</p>
      <p>Canvas should be open now if you want to get started early. No Pressure here.😃</p>
      <p>You need to dedicate many hours per week to master these concepts. If you don't have that kind of time, you may
        want to take the class later when you can devote enough time to be successful.</p>
      <p>You will be using VS Code to create all your assignments and then hosting them on GitHub. Both are tools used
        by professionals in the field. </p>
      <p>We will be using MS Teams for communication and teamwork, so ensure you have it installed and ready to go.</p>
      <p>It's going to be a fantastic and fast-paced ride for the next few weeks, so take your vitamin pills, and let's
        get started.
      <p>If you find yourself overwhelmed within the first week, you can drop the class using these instructions.</p>

      <section>
      <p>SUBJECT: Welcome to Class</p>
        <p>Thanks for joining us for another block class to learn about web front-end development.</p>
      <p>We will use MS Teams for announcements, group communication, and direct questions between students and teachers. I will check messages every day.</p>
        <p>I will NOT be posting any further announcements in Canvas. 😄</p>

    <h3>Connect Teams and Canvas</h3>
    <p>Open Canvas, select settings, click the "Intergrations" tab and activate Microsoft Sync. Click the "Sync Now" button. W A I T. </p>
      <img src="images/teams-integrations.webp">

    <h3>Sort the Canvas Gradebook</h3>
    <p>While your waiting, sort the Canvas gradebok, it makes finding the current assignent much easier. Open your course in Canvas and choose the "Grades". Select the gear in the upper right corner.</p>
    <img src="images/sort-gradebook.webp">

    <h3>Activate your class in MS Teams</h3>
    <p>Once the sync process has finished, you will have a new Teams for your new class. You need to activate the class and let the students in.</p>
    <img src="images/teams-activate.webp">
    <img src="images/teams-activate2.webp">

    <h3>Post a message in Teams</h3>
    <p>Post a message NOT to use the "General Channel". When we get over 100 people talking over 6 weeks, this becomes a mess.🤪</p>
    <img src="images/teams-message.webp">

    <h3>Change the Teams Inforamtion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Select the Teams icon on the left panel.</li>
      <li>Click the new WDD231 team in your list.</li>
      <li>To the right of the team name, select the &mldr; and choose "Manage team" from the drop down menu</li>
      <li>Click the Settings tab. Then expand "Team details" section.</li>

      <li>Click the "Change picture" link and select "Upload" to choose a new image from your files.</li>
      <li>Remember to save. </li>
      <li>NOTE: you may need to wait till after class has started to make the icon change.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Here are my icons if you want to use them for the <a href="images/231-teams-icon-b1.png" target="_blank">first block</a> and the <a href="images/231-teams-icon-b2.png" target="_blank">second block</a>.</p>







    <h3>Add Five standard MS Teams channels for the weekly discussions</h3>
    <p>Add a class channel for each week for class discussions "General Questions - Week 1" etc.</p>
    <img src="images/channels-general.webp">
    <p>Select "Standard" channel</p>
    <img src="images/teams-standard.webp">

    <h3>Add an additional channel called "Job Descriptions (week5). </h3>
    <p>There will be an assignment later that has student sharing job descriptions they have found.</p>

    <h3>Add many more public Channels to Teams for Groupwork</h3>
    <p>Add a new channel in MS teams that exactly matches the names of the People>WDD231Groups in canvas (takes about 10
      minutes)</p>
    <img src="images/channels.webp">

    <h3>Weekly Hints</h3>
    <p>If you have advice, tips, or hints for a specific week then post them to the General Questions for the related week. Hopefully this will encourage students to use these weekly channels for classwide communication.</p>

    <h3>Pre-term Checklist</h3>
    <p>You will get an email link this week for the preterm checlkist. Please review and submit it.</p>

    <h2>Useful Tips</h2>
    <h3>What Section do I have?</h3>
    <p>In Canvas, open Settings and choose "Sections" from the top tab navigation. Your section will be listed.</p>
      <h3>Modify Due Date for One Student</h3>
      <p>On rare occasions students may have personal challenges and need an extension beyond the two week already provided. In these cases you can modify the "Until" date for a sungle student as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open an assignment is Canvas</li>
        <li>Click the Edit button</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom and choose "Assign Access" Manage Assign To</li>
        <li>Click +Add</li>
        <li>Add the student to the "Assign to" box</li>
        <li>Match the due date</li>
        <li>Change the Until date to add a few days.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/due-date.webp">

      <h3>Submission Comments</h3>
      <p>The grading team will respond to the majority of comments left with assignment submissions. When these comments should be addressed by the course instructor, the graders are susposed to notify you. You can view all of these submission comments in one place as shown below.  </p>
      <img src="images/canvas-comments.webp">
      
      <h3>Checking the Pulse of the class.</h3>
      <p>Every week there are a set of questions labeled as "W0x Ponder: 60-second Status Update". You can see how much time students are spending (self reported), what went well, and what they are struggling with. </p>
      <p>Open the weekly survey and click "Survey Statistics". </p>
      <img src="images/survey-statistics.webp">
      <p>Some questions will summarize responses.</p>
      <img src="images/time-spent.webp">
      <p>For questions that are fill in  the blank, you will need to click "Student Analysis" to generate and then download a report of all student responses.</p>
      <img src="images/student-analysis.webp">
      <img src="images/student-analysis2.webp">



<h3>Notification of Disability Accommodations</h3>
<p>On occasion you may get a request for disability accommodations for this class. Most of the requested items like extra time on quizzes and deadline extensions are already built into this course.</p>
<img src="images/accessibility.webp">
<p>If you find a request for "Group Work Modification” as shown above, please send the student a personalized version of the following message.</p>
  <p>Your Accessibility Services letter indicates that you are exempt from group work. If you are able to participate in your group, that would be a good learning experience but you are not required to do so. There are questions every week about your participation in a group. Please answer them in the affirmative so you don't miss any points. <br>

        <p>The final assessment for this class is a multiple-page website, and the best part is that you get to choose the topic.</p>

          <p>Last week, you picked the topic and submitted a project site plan as a single web page.</p>

            <p>This week, you are creating that site! As Elder Uchtdorf shared, "<strong>The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul</strong>"</p>

              <p>This website will show everything you have learned in this and previous classes for this certificate.</p>

                <p>As you may have noticed, there is no teamwork allowed for this project, you on your own.😇</p>

                  <p>You will create a new repository inside your WDD231 account and host all the files there.</p>

                  <p>My friends, working with you during this class has been a great experience; I wish you the best as you create something extraordinary.</p>
