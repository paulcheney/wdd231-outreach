  <main>
    <p>Student outreach includes any work we do to build relationships with students, help clarify course content and
      assignment expectations, and encourage students to persist and do their best in the class. Weekly outreach
      messages will be provided with the expectation that you will personalize them to fit your personality.</p>

        <p>On <time class="date-2b"></time> before class begins, modify the following message and then email it to all

          Inbox</p>
        <div>
          <p><b>SUBJECT:</b> Welcome to WDD231, the best class ever!</p>
          <p>What a fantastic opportunity to work with students from around the world who share a common faith.</p>
          <p>Class begins on <time class="date1a"></time>, and we must hit the ground running.</p>
          <p>You should have completed WDD130 & WDD131 <strong>before</strong> enrolling in this course. </p>
          <p>Canvas should be open now if you want to get started early. No Pressure here.😃</p>
          <p>You need to dedicate many hours per week to master these concepts. If you don't have that kind of time, you may want to take the class later when you can devote enough time to be successful.</p>
          <p>You will be using VS Code to create all your assignments and then hosting them on GitHub. Both are tools
            used by professionals in the field. </p>
            <p>This course requires Advanced Computing Capability to complete the assignments in the course.<br>
            https://www.byupathway.edu/technology-requirements</p>
          <p>We will be using MS Teams for communication and teamwork, so ensure you have it installed and ready to go.
          </p>
          <p>It's going to be a fantastic and fast-paced ride for the next few weeks, so take your vitamin pills, and
            let's
            get started.
          <p>If you find yourself overwhelmed within the first week, you should drop the class.<br>

          <p>This week will be fast and furious as you learn to build you own JSON data file and then import it using

            small screen navigation using CSS Grid and transitions. It's pretty cool. 🥰 If you have any questions,
